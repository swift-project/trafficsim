	Project: VATSIM C++ Shim Library

	Copyright © 2012-2014 Gary Tekulsky 1134195. All rights reserved.
	The below text embodies the ideas of the permissions that the final legal text should allow.
	
	---[The following is a general idea of what the final copyright should generally embody, it is not in effect at this time]---
	This project is available for free to be used by any legitimate project attempting to connect to the Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network (VATSIM).
	The underlying code of this project is protected by the VATSIM NDA. This header file is not protected by the VATSIM NDA. It is requested that this
	shim library only be distributed in the unlinked form by the author or a VATSIM representative unless permission is given. When used by a valid
	project for the VATSIM network, a link to an approved download location should be used to refer other developers to it. The accompanying shared library
	(DLL, SO, etc) may be distributed directly with the compiled application software (Pilot Client, ATC Client, etc) without permission so long as it is used
	in a non-malicious way and the application software has been approved for use on the VATSIM network. This library is not to be used commercially.
	This so-called "License" should remain intact in this header file as written but can be excluded from the application software.



	-----[WARNING]-----

	Generally speaking the VATSIM libraries are not thread-safe, nor are they re-entrant.  The program must assure that only one thread is running library code at a time.

	It is legal to call network sending routines from a network callback.  It is not legal to connect or disconnect or create or dispose of network objects from a network
	callback.

	It is not legal to invoke any voice routines from a voice callback.

	It is recommended that one of the following two methods is used to handle calls to the VATSIM library to deal with the threading limitations:
	   1. Always call library methods from the main thread. The libraries functions do not block, so the program simply needs to call them with adequate frequency
	   2. Always call library methods from a single worker thread and use some kind of synchronizing structure, such as a message queue, to send commands to the library worker
	       thread. Additional message queues may be required for callbacks.

	It is the clients responsibility to call destruction/deallocation routines on all objects/handles.

	This library does not provide any sort of copy/clone functionality.

	-----[WARNING]-----
	Failure to destroy Cvatlib_Network or Cvatlib_Voice_Simple objects may cause resources to not be released. Ensure that all exit paths properly destroy these objects
	using obj->Destroy() so that resources are freed up.

	-----[PROGRAMMING NOTES]-----
	Objects are created using the x::Create() static methods. Objects are destroyed using the obj->Destroy() methods.

	-----[BUILD NOTES]-----
	The VATSIM C++ Shim Library requires a C++11 compatible compiler.

	Tested compilers:
	->Microsoft Windows: Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
	->Apple OS X: Not tested yet
	->GNU/Linux: Not tested yet
